* Generalization of multinomial logistic classifier
* Scores in LR - Unnormalized logistic probablities
  
* Get normalized probablities
  ** Expoenetiate the scores
  ** Normalize them

* Maximize the log likelihood or minimize -ve log likelihood of correct class
     ** Li = -log (P(Y = yi | X = xi))    <- Log likelihood
